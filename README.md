# Coding_Notes

Various random Technology(Frontend, Backend, Miscellaneous) topics that I summarized personally so that I can refer Back to Them in Future.
Some Descriptions have some Japanese romaji word in them and some pretty awful childlike explanations but as it a Personal Notes Track I guess its allowed.

* Vue Vuex
* NPM
* TypeScript
* JavaScript
* Authentication, Authorization
* Regular Expression
* Coding Conventions and Best Practises
* HTML5 CSS3
* Java 
* JSP Servlets
* SQL
* Testing Tools (Jest Junit Swagger Mockito)
