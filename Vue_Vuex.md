### Vue
1. Vue.nextTick() - Vue has a update cycle. Meaning if a DOM element if changed it doesnt immediately execute the update. Nexttick is a technique to literally force the clock to move forward and force the DOM update. 
2. created()
3. updated()
4. V.lazy()


### Vuex
+ Action: Do Something
+ Mutation: Change a State
..+ Action adn Mutation will be dissolved into moving Forward
+ Store: Single source of truth

+ Casting to teach VScode about the type
+ Interface then build Class using interface then use the object {new Class()}  in action or mutation
